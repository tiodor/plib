Put everything in the reference control, auto-manage the memory.
Using this library can make the CPP code like CSharp, but still much faster than CSharp/Java. The Developers no longer need to care about the object's alloc/free or new/delete operations. And when pass parameters to a function, just use the Reference Object.

The Lib is still under developing, and I will add the document as soon as possible.
